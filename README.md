# Heart_Disease_Prediction

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Voting Classifier combining K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes models for healthcare applications. The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy while minimizing false negatives, which is critical in medical contexts.

## Features
1. Combines KNN and Naive Bayes models in a Voting Classifier

2. Trained and tested on healthcare-related datasets

3. Focuses on optimizing recall to reduce false negatives
